Excellent — here is your Replit-ready prompt to implement support for multiple labeled remote file paths in an SFTP data source. This will make your system more scalable, vendor-friendly, and automation-ready.

🧠 Replit Prompt: Extend SFTP Data Source to Support Multiple Remote File Paths
🧾 Instruction
Enhance the SFTP Data Source configuration form and backend to support multiple labeled remote file paths per vendor. Each remote path should be associated with a descriptive label (e.g., “Catalog Feed”, “Inventory Feed”) so users can clearly manage multiple files under one supplier connection.

🎯 UI Requirements
Update the Add Data Source modal for SFTP Connection type:

1. Replace the single Remote Path input with a dynamic list UI:
Each entry contains:

Label (e.g., “Product Catalog”, “Inventory File”)

Remote Path (e.g., /feeds/products.csv)

Allow users to:

➕ Add more file paths

🗑️ Remove any path row

Example UI layout:

markdown
Copy
Edit
[Label]              [Path]
------------------------------
Product Catalog      /feeds/products.csv
Inventory            /feeds/inventory.csv
🧱 Backend Requirements
Data Model Update:

Store file paths in an array of labeled objects:

json
Copy
Edit
"remote_paths": [
  {
    "label": "Product Catalog",
    "path": "/feeds/products.csv"
  },
  {
    "label": "Inventory",
    "path": "/feeds/inventory.csv"
  }
]
Validation:

Ensure at least one labeled path is provided

Validate that paths start with / and contain no invalid characters

⚙️ Ingestion Workflow
Update the ingestion pipeline to:

Loop through remote_paths for each SFTP data source

For each path:

Download file

Match against a configured mapping template (if available)

Log success/failure per file in ingestion logs

Optional:

Allow users to assign mapping templates to each file path (future prompt)

🧪 API Requirements
Accept remote_paths as part of POST/PUT data source creation/update

Return structured file path objects on GET /data-sources/{id}

✅ Output Expectations
User-friendly SFTP form supporting multiple labeled paths

Secure and validated backend data structure

Ingestion process supports looping over each path per supplier

Backward-compatible with single-path configurations
