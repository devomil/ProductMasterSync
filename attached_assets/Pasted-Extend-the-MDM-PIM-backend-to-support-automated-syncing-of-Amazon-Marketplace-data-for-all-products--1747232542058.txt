Extend the MDM/PIM backend to support automated syncing of Amazon Marketplace data for all products with valid UPCs. The system must handle 100,000+ products while respecting Amazon SP-API rate limits, using a scalable and fault-tolerant approach.

‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements
1. Background Sync Engine
Use FastAPI background tasks, APScheduler, or Celery (if available) to run long-running sync jobs

Schedule batch syncs (e.g., every night or on-demand)

2. Rate Limit Compliance
Comply with Amazon SP-API Rate Limits

Catalog Items API: 20 requests/sec, 40 burst

Implement a token bucket or sleep-based rate control mechanism to avoid exceeding limits

üîÅ Sync Workflow
For each batch:

Select a list of products with valid UPCs

Filter by last_amazon_sync timestamp or sync_status = 'pending'

Call GET /catalog/items with the UPC

Extract relevant data: ASIN(s), title, price, sales rank, fulfillment options

Store result in amazon_market_data

Update product record with:

last_amazon_sync

sync_status ("success", "error", etc.)

üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Updates
Extend the products table (or add a sync log table) with:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN last_amazon_sync TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN sync_status VARCHAR(20);
Create sync_logs table (optional) for job tracking:

product_id

timestamp

result ("success", "timeout", "invalid UPC", etc.)

response time

üß™ Testing & Control
Create a route: POST /marketplace/amazon/sync
‚Üí Kicks off the sync for all products or a given subset (by supplier, category, etc.)

Create a route: GET /marketplace/amazon/sync-status
‚Üí Returns number of products synced, errors, pending, and average sync time

üìâ Failure Handling
Log and skip invalid UPCs or failed API calls

Optionally retry failed syncs (with exponential backoff or scheduled retries)

üîê Security
Ensure SP-API credentials are stored as env vars

Add logic to auto-renew Amazon tokens if required

‚úÖ Output Expectations
Working background sync system for Amazon market data

Automatic UPC-based cross-referencing with ASIN listings

Rate-limited, API-compliant design that can scale to 100K+ SKUs

Dashboard/reporting endpoints to monitor progress
