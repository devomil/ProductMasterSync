Objective
Enhance the Mapping Template system to improve usability when mapping fields from a sample file and ensure that the mapping logic is reliably persisted and applied to the full dataset during actual ingestion (e.g., 28,000 products).

✅ 1. Fix the Field Mapping UI Layout
Current Problem:
When I pull in a sample file (e.g., 50 products), the screen becomes cluttered

The field mapping interface becomes too tall and is not scrollable or collapsible

This makes it hard to match source fields to internal schema fields

What to Do:
Make the field mapping UI scrollable within the modal or pane

Add the following enhancements:

Limit initial sample preview to 5 rows with a “Show more” toggle

Make mapping rows collapsible or paginated

Allow columns to auto-align side-by-side instead of stacking vertically

Add a sticky header for the sample preview so users can match values easily

✅ 2. Save the Mapping Template Properly
Current Problem:
After pulling sample data and mapping fields, there is no confirmation that mappings are saved

Mappings do not automatically apply to the main ingestion job

What to Do:
On “Create Template”, store the mapping as a reusable object:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "supplier_id": "CWR",
  "file_label": "Catalog",
  "mappings": {
    "CWR Part Number": "sku",
    "Manufacturer Part Number": "mfg_part_number",
    "UPC Code": "upc",
    "Quantity Available to Ship (Combined)": "stock_total"
  }
}
Show a confirmation toast: ✅ “Mapping template saved and ready for ingestion”

✅ 3. Ensure Mapping Is Applied in Full File Ingest
Requirements:
When I later trigger a full data import (e.g., from the catalog.csv on SFTP), the system should:

Detect existing mapping template based on:

Supplier + file label or path

Apply the saved mapping to the raw file headers

Normalize and ingest into the master_catalog using mapped fields

Optional Improvements:
Show a banner: “Using mapping template: Catalog - CWR”

Allow override/edit of the mapping during ingest (future)

✅ Output Expectations
A clean, scrollable field mapping UI

Mapping templates persist and are listed under "Mapping Templates"

Full ingestion uses saved templates automatically

Error logging if field mapping fails (e.g., missing headers)
